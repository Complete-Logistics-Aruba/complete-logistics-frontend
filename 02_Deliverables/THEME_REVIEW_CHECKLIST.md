# Theme Review Checklist

**Purpose:** To guide the owner during visual verification of theme and branding after developer delivery.

## What to Verify (Visual QA)

### ✅ General

- [ ] The application loads without errors and shows the Devias layout (top bar + sidebar + content area).

### 🎨 Colors & Branding

- [ ] Primary color **#0B4EA2 (blue)** appears on buttons, active links, and main highlights.
- [ ] Secondary color **#F58220 (orange)** appears on hover states or secondary accents.
- [ ] Background color is **#F9FAFB** (light gray) across main content.
- [ ] Text color looks dark gray/black for primary text, lighter gray for secondary text.
- [ ] Logo displays correctly in the top bar or sidebar (not stretched or blurry).
- [ ] Favicon (browser tab icon) shows the correct symbol.

### 🧱 Layout & Components

- [ ] Sidebar and top bar are consistent with your brand colors.
- [ ] Rounded corners (~12px) visible on buttons, cards, and text fields.
- [ ] Typography matches Inter/Roboto fonts; consistent across all pages.

### 💡 Behavior

- [ ] Light mode only (no dark mode toggle yet).
- [ ] Clicking navigation links changes content without reloading the entire page.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs reflect the current page name correctly.

### 🧾 Admin Check (Optional for Future)

- [ ] Admin page exists as a placeholder route (visible for now).
- [ ] Theme variables are defined in `theme.ts` (developer confirmation).

---

**Expected Outcome:** Visual consistency with your brand colors, logo, and general design language.
